    <h1>How to solve a rubik's cube?</h1>
    <h2 class="emphasis"> Basics of Rubiks'cubes </h2>
     
    <p>Many people that never solved a Rubik's cube think that it is solved face by face,
      each colour separately. This way you couldn’t ever solve the cube because every time 
      you start to solve the next colour the previous one would get mixed up. In fact,
     the cube is solved layer by layer. We use algorithms, in other words a sequence of moves,
      to solve a Rubik’s cube. To be able to learn the algorithms you need to know the notation 
      used for face of the layer.

    <p> Usually the top layer is the yellow face of the cube and the bottom layer is the white face.
     But your cube can be rotated any face up for it to be solved. And it doesn’t
      matter which colour is facing but note that this is the most common way to explain it, 
      so don’t confuse your sides when solving it with a different colour face as the top laye
